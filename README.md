# All the News That's Fit to Scrape

### What Is *All the News That's Fit to Scrape*
  1. Whenever a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from New York Times and display them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to the application database. At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

     * Photos, bylines, and so on.

  2. Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
